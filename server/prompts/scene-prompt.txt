Write a compelling scene that:

1. Follows proper screenplay format with scene heading (INT/EXT, location, time), action descriptions, character names, dialogue, and parentheticals.

2. Creates a strong visual impression through detailed but concise action descriptions.

3. Includes natural, character-driven dialogue that reveals personality and advances the plot.

4. Has a clear dramatic purpose within the larger story.

5. Shows character emotions through actions and dialogue rather than stating them directly.

6. Uses proper screenplay techniques and formatting.

Remember these formatting guidelines:
- Scene heading: INT/EXT. LOCATION - TIME OF DAY in ALL CAPS
- Action paragraphs: Concise, present tense, visual
- Character names: ALL CAPS when speaking
- Dialogue: Conversational but purposeful
- Parentheticals: Used sparingly for essential direction

Create a scene that would work effectively in a professional screenplay, maintaining consistent character voices and advancing the story in a meaningful way.
