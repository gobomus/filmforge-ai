Write a compelling screenplay that:

1. Follows proper screenplay format with scene headings (INT/EXT, location, time), action descriptions, character names, dialogue, and parentheticals.

2. Shows rather than tells, focusing on visual storytelling.

3. Creates natural, character-driven dialogue that reveals personality and advances the plot.

4. Maintains a clear three-act structure with proper pacing.

5. Uses screenplay techniques like visual metaphors, motifs, and subtext.

6. Focuses on external action and visual elements rather than internal thoughts.

7. Keeps scene descriptions concise and impactful.

8. Uses proper screenplay transitions when needed.

Remember these formatting guidelines:
- Scene headings are in ALL CAPS (INT. LOCATION - DAY)
- Character names are in ALL CAPS when introduced and in dialogue headers
- Action paragraphs are brief and visual
- Dialogue is concise and revealing
- Use parentheticals sparingly

Create an engaging, professional screenplay that effectively translates the concept into a visual story. The screenplay should be suitable for the intended length and genre while exploring the specified themes.
